This is a repo for my personal scripts to be used with the Four Letter Phat display for Raspberry Pi.

These scripts use the following dependency: [fourletter-phat](https://github.com/pimoroni/fourletter-phat)
The display can be found [here.](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/four-letter-phat)
A getting started guide can be found [here.](https://learn.pimoroni.com/tutorial/sandyj/getting-started-with-four-letter-phat)
